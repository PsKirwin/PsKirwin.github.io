I am a graduate student (MASc) at the [University of British Columbia, Canada](https://www.ubc.ca/), affiliated with the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) and the [Quantum Matter Institute](https://qmi.ubc.ca/). My advisors are [Lukas Chrostowski](https://ece.ubc.ca/lukas-chrostowski/) and [Jeff Young](https://phas.ubc.ca/users/jeff-young).

My research interests lie broadly in optical resonators for quantum technology applications. I am particularly interested in nonlinear cavity systems in silicon-based platforms. These systems can be used, for example, in photon-pair generation, deterministic single photon sources, or photon frequency conversion. 

I previously worked on integrated cavities for the enhancement of strained hexagonal boron nitride single photon emission, TR-MOKE experiments for spin dynamics in GaAsBi, and optimizing nanostructured perovskite solar cells.

I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, aikido, and music.
